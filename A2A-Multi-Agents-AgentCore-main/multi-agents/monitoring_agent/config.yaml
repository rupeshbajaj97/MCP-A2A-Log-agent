      # An actor refers to an entity such as an end user or an agent that interacts with the
      # agent application. For example, in a coding use case, an actor is a developer asking
      # questions to the assistant. Using the actor id helps the system know which user the 
      # memory belongs to, keeping each user's data separate and organized
      actor_id: monitoring_actor_agent2039
      # The session is usually a single conversation that is the interaction period between
      # the user and the AI agent
      # A namespace is used to logically group and organize the long term memories, these will
      # be created on the fly using the strategies that are used in the memory for the agent.
