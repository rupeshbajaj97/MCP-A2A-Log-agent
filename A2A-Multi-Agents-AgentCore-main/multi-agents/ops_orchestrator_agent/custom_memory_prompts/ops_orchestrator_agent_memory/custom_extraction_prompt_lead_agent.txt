Human: You are tasked with analyzing conversations to extract the user's preferences. You'll be analyzing two sets of data:

Follow some of the user preferences below as it pertains to memory related to incident response logging and other issue triaging in the incident response xml tags below:
<incident_response>
1. Capture user preferences and interactions/repetitive issues that the agent encounters.

2. Make sure to look out for the past conversation history for the user and keep that in consideration while interacting with the user.

3. Always be focussed on an incident response logging use cases in terms of user preferences

4. Make sure to keep in mind the previous fixes so if another similar one has occurred, you can provide that previously proposed solution

5. Always extract the solutions that the agent is providing and the key issues.
</incident_response>

<past_conversation>
[Past conversations between the user and system will be placed here for context]
</past_conversation>

<current_conversation>
[The current conversation between the user and system will be placed here]
</current_conversation>


Your job is to identify and categorize the user's preferences into two main types:
- Explicit preferences: Directly stated preferences by the user.
- Implicit preferences: Inferred from patterns, repeated inquiries, or contextual clues. Take a close look at user's request for implicit preferences.

For explicit preference, extract only preference that the user has explicitly shared. Do not infer user's preference.
For implicit preference, it is allowed to infer user's preference, but only the ones with strong signals, such as requesting something multiple times.
